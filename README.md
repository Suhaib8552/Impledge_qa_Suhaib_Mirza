# **Exercise 1: AutomatedSourceCode Test Cases for Adding/Deleting a Package**
Using Selenium WebDriver, this Python script automates Test Cases 01 (Add a package) and 02 (Delete a package). After navigating to the designated application URL and interacting with the web components to complete the necessary tasks, the script ends the browser session.

# Steps to Execute:
Install Python
Install Selenium
Download WebDriver: Download the appropriate WebDriver for your browser (e.g., ChromeDriver for Chrome) and ensure it's in your system PATH.
Update the Script
Run the Script
# Design Decisions and Approach:
Chose Python for its readability and simplicity.
Used Selenium WebDriver for browser automation due to its wide adoption and support.
Set up WebDriver and navigate to the application URL.
Execute Test Case 01: Add a package by interacting with the relevant elements.
Execute Test Case 02: Delete a package using appropriate element locators.
Close the browser after completing both test cases.
